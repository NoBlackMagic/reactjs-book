# ReactJS - fast & right

Front-end web development is growing huge. Today **Javascript is the must-to-have skill to survive** in almost every civilised area of planet Earth. And I know from some good friends that _Javascript is spreading wide on planet Mars too_!

ReactJS is a relatively young platform that is gathering a gigantic momentum because it plays a small and well scoped role in providing a **predictable and damn fast rendering library** to your application.

To get an _HelloWorld_ example up and running is trivial. This course will guide you through some less trivial setup steps, we'll talk about code structure, quality and you'll run tests.

## Basic Steps

- [get your computer ready](basic-steps/setup.md)
- [get your hands on Webpack](basic-steps/webpack.md)
- yes, we'll run through an Hello World!
- what about CSS? Meet Gulp!
- let's talk LESS or SASS
- let's talk ES6 and ES7

## Light Fast Development

- about Webpack Hot Loading
- inline your CSS
- run your dev-server
- enable sourcemaps

## ReactJS & Redux

- about app's state
- actions & services
- dumb components & smart components
- where is the complex code? I don't see it anymore!

## Play Safe

- check on code quality
- unit testing in ReactJS
- meet Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon

## Release your baby!

- target your production bundle
- code compression
- let libraries live outside your app
