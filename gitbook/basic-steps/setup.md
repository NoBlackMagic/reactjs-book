# Get your computer ready!

This chapter lists all the systems you shall need on your machine in order to be up and running with our examples. 

> We use a _Mac_ and all the instructions are meant to be executed on 
> a _Mac's Terminal_ app.

If you are using a different system somw of those tools may not work properly (or not work at all). Eventually you just need `NodeJS v0.12.7`or greater in order to run the code presented with the book.


## Homebrew

_Homebrew_ is a **package manager** build in _Ruby_ which is shipped with your _Mac_. This tool will make very easy to install other software.

## Nodeenv

_Nodeenv_ is a NodeJS version manager. It makes very easy to run multiple versions of NodeJS on your machine. This may be very useful if you have to work on lecagy code and need to run old stuff.
